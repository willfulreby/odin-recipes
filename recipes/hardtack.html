    <h1>Hardtack</h1>

    <h2>Hardtack</h2>
    <p>Hardtack is a very hard cracker that is used to extend the shelf life of the flour nearly indefinitely. It has been used by sailors and militaries back before refrigeration was around. Hardtack, when properly created, is very shelf stable.</p>
    <p>The down side to this cracker is tha tit must be softened before eating. Most will use a soup or stew for this. Just place the Hardtack in the soup/stew while eating. The hardtack will soak up the liquid softening enough to eat over time. To have it nearly all softened when eating, place it in the soup/stew as it is being cooked</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups flour, I recommend whole wheat</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, water and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>After mixing completely, the dough should be a little dry (and not stick to your fingers)</li>
            <li>If your mix is still too sticky, you can add more flour in small increments until the dough is dry enough.</li>
            <li>Use a roller to spread out the dough on a counter, large cutting board, etc. until it reaches a thickness of roughly 1/3 to 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li>To prevent sticking to the counter or cutting board, you should spread a little flour on the surface before rolling the dough. Also spread a little flour on top of the dough to prevent the roller from sticking to the dough.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into squares (e.g. 3 inch squares). You can create square hardtack “biscuits” by cutting the dough horizontally & vertically on a large cutting board.</li>
            <li>Poke narrow holes in the hardtack biscuits with a chopstick or fork. The holes should go all the way through to the other side of the hardtack. This prevents the hardtack from puffing up.</li>
            <li>Place the hardtack biscuits on a baking sheet/tray.</li>
            <li>Put the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 375 F. Wear oven mitts.</li>
            <li>Flip the hardtack over with a spatula and bake for another 30 minutes. Wear oven mitts.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Wear oven mitts. Then use a spatula to remove the hardtack from the baking sheet. Place the hardtack biscuits on a cooling rack in order to cool down.</li>            
        </ol>
